# Automated-temp-folder-wipe
Clears your temp folder

- Edit the .py file and change the directory to your temp folder directory if you want to use this garbage

- Make sure 'audio.mp3' is in the same directory as 'tempclear.py'

- As I've stated in the release, don't download this garbage, it's broken and doesn't work as intended

- If you want to change the directory to something else that doesnt need admin privileges to delete files then this program might function
